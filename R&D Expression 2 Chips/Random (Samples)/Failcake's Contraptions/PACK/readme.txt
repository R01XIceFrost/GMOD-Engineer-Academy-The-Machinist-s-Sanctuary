I didn't realize there was FailCake's E2 Pack from the Dropbox which he made in made 2014.
The ones from garrysmods.org Failcake's E2 packs linked in his videos are dead links and I retrieve what I can with Wayback Machine from Wiremod Forums manually,
I guess this is like extras and didn't totally wasted my time retrieving those contraptions the ones not included in his Dropbox pack
