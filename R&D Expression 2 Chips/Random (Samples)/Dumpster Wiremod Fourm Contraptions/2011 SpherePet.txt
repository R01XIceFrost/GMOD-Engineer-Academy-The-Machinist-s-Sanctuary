About
I haven't worked on an E2 or a while, and came up with an idea. A pet E2.
Two days into development got me this far. Although, the first day, I was
very tired and went to bed about 2 hours of the start, and eventually
became a project the next day.

After getting this far. I'm thinking of adding a shop to buy food to feed
your pet, because so far, your able to feed it without buying anything.

You may think this is sounding like "My Lil' Bastard" (A adult swim game)
and I didn't expect it to come this close to be honest. It wasn't meant
be somewhat like that game.

Pet Caring Information
The first thing to look after in your pet is its hunger. Although you will
be notified of its hunger stages by hints.

To feed a pet, look at it and hold E.

What is not fixed in this version, is that it doesn't matter how far you
are from the pet, you can be a mile away and still be able to feed it.

The second... well, this should be the first. Is to look after your pet!
Your pet can easily wander off and do "leaps of faith." These pet features
will be later explained in the guide.

Your pet will age and may eventually pass away. The farthest Ive seen a pet
live was 79. The maximum life span of a SpherePet is 100... or it was 99.

Unfreeze your pet when you get it or it will die.

Letting your pet get stuck or frozen for a certain amound of time may kill it.
This is bad. To avoid the pet from getting in trouble, I suggest you create
a cage or pen for it to stay in.

Pet Abilities
The default movement of your pet is to hop around. Your pet will hop in
random directions but a limited distance. So keep a close eye on your pet.

A leap of faith is a leap, but the leap can vary and can be very far. Your
pet will occasionally do this, and is not rare.

Your pet will also make noises.

If you missed the hunger hints and do not have any idea of how hungry your
pet is. Walk up to it and look at its outline. The more red the outline is, the
hungrier it is.

More to come
The pet will poo.
Adding a follow ability.
Memorize where its home is and return. (May not always work, multiple reasons why.)
Being able to call your pet (May not always work, multiple reasons why.)
Pet will mature until 20, and becomes and adult. - Done

More will be added from public ideas. So please post them and I will consider the idea.
If I have forgotten any information, it should be added shortly.

There are no pictures for now, but trust me, it is fun.
