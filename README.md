Welcome to the Machinist’s Sanctuary! Here, I craft specialized, uniquely styled engineering documents for Wiremod/ACE (Armored Combat Extended) communities. Frustrated by the lack of documents (most of them are ancient at this point) on Wiremod/ACF/ACE, which often require excessive reading theories and fail to provide straightforward guidance with sufficient examples, I seek to offer clear and direct guidance, unlike ancient YouTube Wiremod/ACF/ACE tutorials that can last from 20 minutes to an hour (time wasters if not explained properly or not understood due to the experience gap by the average Joe, or if they are intimidated by the effort required—too hardcore, in other words).
