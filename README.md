Yo, welcome to the Machinist's Sanctuary! I whip up dope, unique engineering docs for Wiremod/ACE crews. Sick of long GMOD YouTube tutorials and the struggle when peeps don't know the ropes? I got this cool way to get on the same level as the GMOD pros, so you don't freak about the grind or be sketched asking for help on Discord 'cause of troll vibes and gatekeeping. Basically, no more dick measuring contests.
